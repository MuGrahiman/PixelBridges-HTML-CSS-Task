## My Tasks:
1. Cloning: I need to create an exact clone of https://zomi.finance/
2. Branding Update: Integrate the "Romi.Finance" logo provided to me, ensuring it replaces the existing logo. Additionally, wherever the name "Zomi Finance" appears, replace it with "Romi.Finance".
3. User Experience: Ensure a front-end experience that's both intuitive and functional.

My focus? Specifically, the "Home", "Dashboard", and "Earn" sections. The other sections can be disregarded.
Ensure my HTML is clean, and all required assets, JS, and CSS are structured well.
